Vim allows you to redirect cscope's output to the quickfix window with the 'cscopequickfix' option. Below is the suggested value in :help 'cscopequickfix':

set cscopequickfix=s-,c-,d-,i-,t-,e-
From there, you can search for apple with:

:cs f s apple
view the list of matches with:

:cw[indow]
jump to the next match with:

:cn[ext]
jump to the previous match with:

:cp[revious]
and, of course, use the mouse or the keyboard to select entries in the quickfix window.

Bonus: add this to your vimrc to skip the :cwindow step:

augroup qf
    autocmd!
    autocmd QuickFixCmdPost * cwindow
augroup END

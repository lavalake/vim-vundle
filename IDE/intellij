Nifty tooling
The first cool thing you'll notice after enabling version control for a project ist the git information on the bottom right 
corner (Something like Git:master). It tells you which branch you're on and if you click it a small menu pops up with a list
of your local and remote branches. You can easily switch between branches, checkout new branches, compare them, merge them, 
delete them and so on. Nothing special so far.

One handy feature (that is hard to do with a CLI command) is the Annotate view: it displays -per line-  the date and author of 
the according commit that the line last changed. How cool is that? Just right-click the line-number to see who you can ask when
you think "WTF is this line doing here?" ;-)
